# vue-blokus
Blokus is a four-player strategy game in which players place polyominoes on the board which are allowed to be
adjacent at the corners but not at the edges of another polyomino of the same color. Each polyomino is 
a permutation of laterally connected tiles which follow every possible configuration permutation from 1 to 5 tiles.

A player who places down a 5-tile polyomino receives 5 points, 4 points for a 4-tile polyomino, and so on.
The winner of the game is s/he who recevies the greatest number of points. Although tiles are allowed to 
be touching only at the corners of common color pieces, there is no such restriction on pieces of other colors,
as we see below.
